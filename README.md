Some Termux dot files on my phone.

They are:

- `.zshrc` : many personal stuff, many shortcuts and alias
- `.bashrc` : not much configured since I use `zsh` `.zshrc` 
- `termux.properties` : especially configured extra keys for `neovim`

- `.init.vim` : mainly configured for **Python** and **JavaScript** "IDE". Mostly copy and paste snippets from a few Internet guides.

They may not work for you, consider not blindly copy and paste.
